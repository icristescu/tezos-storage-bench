## Description

The goal of these files is to be able to have a reproductible build of `irmin`
for a benchmark purpose. It is used with `opam monorepo` and `dune`.

## Disclamer

Files older than september 21 only work in the context of `irmin-bench`. They
are intended to be used with the following configuration:
  - `ocaml.4.13.x`
  - `opam-monorepo.0.2.7`
  - `dune.2.9.3`

:warning: We can't predict the behaviour if it is used with another configuration!
